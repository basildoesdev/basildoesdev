## 📝 **About Me**

Hey, I’m Basil! I’m a frontend developer with a love for creating clean, responsive web apps and exploring new tech trends like AI-driven development. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of backend magic with MongoDB and Node.js. Lately, I’ve been diving into serverless architecture and building CRUD applications with MongoDB and Netlify. I also have a strong background in graphic and web design.
